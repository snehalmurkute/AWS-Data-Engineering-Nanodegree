## 📁 Projects Included

| # | Project | Description |
|--|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Data Modeling with Cassandra](./data_modeling_cassandra) | Designed NoSQL data model with Apache Cassandra and created an scalable ETL pipeline to ingest data from S3 into query-optimized tables for analytical queries. |
| 2 | [Data Warehouse on AWS](./data_warehouse_aws) | Developed a cloud data warehouse and designed star schema to structure raw data with Redshift to support analytics on large datasets stored in S3. |
| 3 | [Data Lake with Spark](./data_lake_spark) | Processed and transformed raw data from S3 using PySpark to build a scalable data lake. |
| 4 | [Data Pipelines with Airflow](./airflow_data_pipelines) | Orchestrated complex data workflows using Apache Airflow and automated the ETL process. |
